- write a makefile that shows how to relate to all the targets
of a specific makefile rule. Still havent found a way to do that.
	for instance, if I write:
	a b: c
		[commands]
	how do I relate to BOTH a and b from the commands?
- write how to refer to all the things on the right hand side of a rule
	a: b c
	How do I relate to "b c"? "$<" only refers to b.
- create a latex book or other book from all of this content to explain
	how make(1) works.
